###  My Story

I’m not a professional yet — I’m just starting my journey in AI.  
I don’t have much experience, but I’m eager to learn, improve, and create.  
All I want right now is **experience** — not money, just opportunities to grow and learn.  

If you give me a chance, I’ll give my best in return.
