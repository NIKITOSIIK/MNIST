About Me

I’m 19 years old and still at the very beginning of my journey.
I’m not a professional yet — I don’t have much experience, and there are many things I don’t know.
But what I do have is a strong desire to learn and improve every day.

Recently, I’ve become deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence and everything related to it — neural networks, deep learning, and the way machines can learn and think.
My dream is to work in this field and to grow as an AI engineer through constant practice and curiosity.

At this stage, I’m not looking for money — what I truly want is experience.
I’m ready to learn, experiment, and dedicate my time to developing useful skills.

If you can give me a chance, I’ll give my full effort in return.
